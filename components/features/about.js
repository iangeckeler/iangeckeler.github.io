        <p>Hey! My name's Ian, I’m a junior software developer and data analyst. I thrive in startup environments and teams where people “wear many hats”. As an Applied and Computational Math major and a self-taught web developer, I am an entrepreneurial self-starter, an extremely quick learner, and a versatile team player. 
            <br></br><br></br>
        I have experience developing full-stack applications with Node.js and React, and analyzing data to drive business strategy in Python, R, and Excel. It never takes me more than a week to be up and running with a new framework or tool.
            <br></br><br></br>

        I find that my talents and disposition work best in environments that are fast-paced and that value creative input. I love to dive into ambitious projects and work on teams of positive, energetic, and talented individuals.
            <br></br><br></br>

I am currently interested in full-stack development, data science, and the application of both to improve the decisions of companies and people.
<br></br><br></br>
I'm bullish on the capability of technology to solve many of humanity's problems, but also wary of its misuse. For that reason, I want to be as involved as I can in crafting technologies which will increase the autonomy of inidividuals around the globe. In the future, my sights are set on crafting an impactful software product and becoming involved in venture capital to support entrepreneurship and innovative technology.
<br></br><br></br>
In my free time, I read books on psychology, economics, philosophy, and business, and try to host as many discussions about solving the world's problems as I can. I am outspoken about the limitations of our current political, educational, and healthcare systems, and hope to disrupt them in the future.
