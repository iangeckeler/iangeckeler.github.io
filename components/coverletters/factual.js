Dear Factual Hiring Manager, 
<br></br>
<br></br>
I’ve been following Factual for some time and wanted to express my interest in bringing my talents and energy to bear for your engineering team. From my research, I’ve gathered that Factual has a premier team of talented, smart, and passionate individuals. I love the idea of working for a “neutral data” company, knowing the increasing importance of data in our everyday lives and for solving complex problems. 
<br></br>
<br></br>
I’m a new grad from USC with a Bachelor’s in Applied and Computational Mathematics, as well as a self-taught web developer and extremely fast learner. Straight off the heels of an internship at the startup CoEfficient Labs in Santa Monica, I know that I could make moves with your squad out in Culver City, and am excited to prove it. I took a look at both the new-grad and internship positions, and wanted to highlight my relevant experience for the Full-stack and Data intern roles. 
<br></br>
<br></br>
<b>Developer Experience</b>
<br></br>Python - I’ve developed multiple projects in Python; from data handling and visualization, to cron scripts that web-scrape LinkedIn.  
<br></br>Full-stack - I built two full-stack applications this November with no previous experience of Back-end development.   
<br></br>Technologies - Comfortable with Git workflow, Node.js Webpack, SASS, HTML/CSS, ReactJS, responsive design, and front-end libraries like Axios, jQuery, and Bootstrap  
<br></br>Data - I’m familiar with the Anaconda data science distribution, including RStudio, and have conducted statistical analyses in Excel to drive business insights  
<br></br>Communication - I’m a comfortable public speaker/presenter and gave weekly reports to the CEO at CoEfficient Labs regarding quarterly KPI's  
<br></br>Speed - My portfolio website was coded in a day, written in ReactJS, and developed with the Webpack server and bundler  
<br></br>UI/UX - I have designed and built mobile-optimized landing pages for eCommcerce clients such as “Ziran”, and developed a leadflow chatbot to improve website customer experience  
<br></br>NoSQL - I’ve used cloud databases like mLab and MongoDB Compass, and am familiar with CRUD operations and the Mongo driver/shell  
<br></br><br></br>

<b>General Startup Experience</b>
<br></br>During my time at CoEfficient Labs, I was fully responsible for several high-profile projects which directly impacted the company’s bottom line. I know that at a startup, every team member is expected to punch of above their weight class and be an “intrapreneur”.  
<br></br>As a board member of Spark SC, USC’s pioneering entrepreneurship organization, I have had the opportunity to flex my leadership skills putting on events like USC’s startup career fair, and have experience email marketing, writing content, promoting signups, and driving engagement across platforms, all while working in extremely agile, high-autonomy teams  
<br></br><br></br>
In my experience, it is my diversity of talent and knowledge that allows me to contribute to teams in unexpected ways. I have the breadth of experience I do because I am not afraid to go outside the box, be proactive, and dive headfirst into a new challenge. Especially in a startup where roles are fluid depending on the day, and iteration cycles are fast, I have found that my flexibility and versatile temperament make me a dynamic asset. I’m a self-starter with high-energy, and love the positive feedback loop that comes from the excitement of a startup looking to move fast and break things. Most of all I am a flexible and team-player that when given the time, can become a juggernaut at whatever I dedicate myself to mastering, especially when given the proper mentorship. 
<br></br><br></br>

If you’re interested in what I have to offer Factual, I would love to hear from you.
