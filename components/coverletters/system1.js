Dear System1 Hiring Manager, 
<br></br><br></br>

After speaking with Alex about the awesome culture and product over at System1, I had to reach out and express my interest in bringing my talents and energy to bear for your engineering team. I’m fascinated with predicting human behavior and marketing as a whole, and System1 seems to perfectly reside in the intersection. 
<br></br>
<br></br>

I’m a new grad from USC with a Bachelor’s in Applied and Computational Mathematics, as well as a self-taught web developer and extremely fast learner. Straight off the heels of an internship at the advertising startup CoEfficient Labs in Santa Monica, I know that I can make moves with your squad out in Venice, and am excited to prove it. I took a look at the positions offered on your website and BuiltinLA, and highlighted my relevant skills.
<br></br>
<br></br>

<b>Developer Experience</b>
<br></br>Python - I’ve developed multiple projects in Python, from data handling and visualization, to cron scripts that web-scrape LinkedIn.  
<br></br>Full-stack - I built two full-stack applications on my own this November with no previous experience of Back-end development.   
<br></br>Technologies - Comfortable with Git workflow, Node.js Webpack, SASS, HTML/CSS, ReactJS, responsive design, and front-end libraries like Axios, jQuery, and Bootstrap  
<br></br>Data – I have experience using Excel and the Anacond data science distribution, including RStudio, to drive business insights and conduct statistical analysiss 
<br></br>Communication - I’m a comfortable public speaker, presenter, and gave weekly reports to the CEO at CoEfficient Labs regarding quarterly KPIs
<br></br>Speed - My portfolio website was coded in a day, written in ReactJS, and developed with the Webpack server and bundler  
<br></br>UI/UX - I have designed and built mobile-optimized landing pages for eCommcerce clients like The Ziran and developed a website chatbot to improve website experience  
<br></br>NoSQL - I’ve used cloud databases like mLab and MongoDB Compass and am familiar with the Mongo driver and shell  
<br></br>AWS - In my previous role at CoEfficient labs, I was tasked with troubleshooting our website which was deployed on AWS, additionally, I have developed projects on AWS Cloud9.  
<br></br><br></br>
<b>General Marketing/Startup Experience</b>
<br></br>During my time at CoEfficient Labs, I also worked closely on the Facebook and Google advertising strategy for clients spanning the SaaS, eCommerce, and FinTech industries. I’m confident that this industry knowledge would give me an edge in understanding the needs of System1’s clients better and general mission and operations.  
<br></br>As a board member of Spark SC, USC’s pioneering entrepreneurship organization, I have had the opportunity to flex my leadership skills putting on events like USC’s startup career fair, and have experience email marketing, writing content, promoting signups, and driving engagement across platforms, all while working in extremely agile, high-autonomy teams
<br></br><br></br>
In my experience, it is my diversity of talent and knowledge that allows me to make a large impact in any team. I have the breadth of experience I do because I am not afraid to go outside the box, be proactive, and dive headfirst into a new challenge. Especially in a startup where roles are fluid and iteration cycles are fast, I have found that my flexibility and versatile temperament make me a dynamic asset. I’m a self-starter with high-energy, and love the positive feedback loop that comes from the excitement of a startup looking to move fast and break things. Most of all I am a flexible and team-player that when given the time, can become a juggernaut at whatever I dedicate myself to mastering.
<br></br><br></br>
If you’re interested in what I have to offer System1, I would love to hear from you.
