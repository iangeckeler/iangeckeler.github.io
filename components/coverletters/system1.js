        <p>
        Dear Hiring Manager, 
<br></br><br></br>

After speaking with Alex about the awesome culture and product over at System1, I had to reach out and express my interest in coming to bring my talents and energy to bear for your engineering team. I’m a new grad from USC with a Bachelor’s in Applied and Computational Mathematics, as well as a self-taught web developer and extremely fast learner. Straight off the heels of an internship at the advertising startup CoEfficient Labs in Santa Monica, I know that I could be making moves with your squad out in Venice, and am excited to prove it. I took a look at the positions offered on your website and BuiltinLA, and highlighted my relevant skills.
<br></br>
<br></br>

Developer Experience
<br></br>
- Python - I’ve developed all sorts of projects in Python from data handling and visualization, to cron scripts that web-scrape LinkedIn.  
<br></br>
- Full-stack - I built two full-stack applications on my own this November with no previous experience of Back-end development.   
<br></br>
- Technologies - Comfortable with Git workflow, Node.js Webpack, SASS, HTML/CSS, ReactJS, responsive design, and front-end libraries like Axios, jQuery, and Bootstrap  
<br></br>
- Data - I’m familiar with the Anaconda data science distribution as well as R and have conducted statistical analyses and have experience using Excel to drive business insights
<br></br>
- Communication - I’m a comfortable public speaker, presenter, and gave weekly reports to the CEO at CoEfficient Labs on our marketing and sales figures.   
<br></br>
- Speed - My portfolio website was coded in a day, written in ReactJS, and developed with the Webpack server and bundler  
<br></br>
- UI/UX - I have designed and built mobile-optimized landing pages for eCommcerce clients like The Ziran and developed a website chatbot to improve website experience  
<br></br>
- NoSQL - I’ve used cloud databases like mLab and MongoDB Compass and am familiar with the Mongo driver and shell  
<br></br>
- AWS - In my previous role at CoEfficient labs, I was tasked with troubleshooting our website which was deployed on AWS, additionally, I have developed projects on AWS Cloud9.  
<br></br>
<br></br>

General Marketing/Startup Experience
<br></br>
- During my time at CoEfficient Labs, I also worked closely on the Facebook and Google advertising strategy for clients spanning the SaaS, eCommerce, and FinTech industries. I’m confident that this industry knowledge would give me an edge in understanding the needs of System1’s clients better and general mission and operations.  
<br></br>
- As a board member of Spark SC, USC’s pioneering entrepreneurship organization, I have had the opportunity to flex my leadership skills putting on events like USC’s startup career fair, and have experience email marketing, writing content, promoting signups, and driving engagement across platforms, all while working in extremely agile, high-autonomy teams
<br></br>
<br></br>

You may be thinking, that none of these skills fit an explicit role, but in my experience, it is my diversity of talent and knowledge that allows me to contribute to teams in unexpected ways. I have the breadth of experience I do because I am not afraid to go outside the box, be proactive, and dive headfirst into a new challenge. Especially in a startup where roles are fluid depending on the day and iteration cycles are fast, I have found that my flexibility and versatile temperament make me a dynamic asset. I’m a self-starter, with high-energy, and love the positive feedback loop that comes from the excitement of a startup looking to move fast and break things. Most of all I am a flexible and team-player that when given the time, can become a juggernaut at whatever I dedicate myself to mastering, just point me in the direction and I’ll run with it.  
<br></br>
Sincerely,<br></br>
Ian Geckeler
